# Introduction

This file provides information on the results of the AI generated suggestions

## https://github.com/cornshuckin2/etm-676-ai-qa/pull/4

- All suggested tests failed due to using the wrong locators.
  - Should we let AI read our file to avoid this?
- The suggestions on priority I agree with (Locked out user from P1 to P2).
- The suggestions on priority for the generated tests I agree with.

# https://github.com/cornshuckin2/etm-676-ai-qa/pull/5

- All suggested tests failed due to using the wrong locators.
- The suggestions were ok, but one test is not valid. Also, why didn't we get all of these suggestions on the first run?
- The suggestion on priority seemed a bit off. Error messages are important but not critical (P1).

Second Run

- It gave suggestions for new test cases, but those test cases already existed.
- Updating to a stronger model 4o-mini to 4o

# https://github.com/cornshuckin2/etm-676-ai-qa/pull/8

- Missing test cases were not helpful, since it is an e2e
- It did mention that the test case was well put together and part of a crucial workflow

# https://github.com/cornshuckin2/etm-676-ai-qa/pull/11

- Missing test cases did not provide any helpful insight
- It suggested p3, which I agree with as they are not critical
- Noted that login is taking long, which is a good suggestion for improvements
