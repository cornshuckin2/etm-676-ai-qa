# AI-Driven Test Automation Framework

---

## Project Overview

This project aims to create an AI-driven test automation framework using Playwright, with integration of AI to optimize and enhance the quality assurance process. The framework will automatically generate and execute tests based on observed changes in the application code, provide insights, and streamline the testing process to speed up development cycles.

The project will:
1. Find and train an AI model to assist in building and running test cases.
2. Create a Playwright-based test framework and integrate it with the AI model.
3. Deploy the system in a CI/CD pipeline for continuous feedback.
4. Optimize test execution time and resource utilization.
5. Evaluate the effectiveness of the AI-driven approach compared to traditional test automation methods.

The project will be tested against the **[SauceDemo](https://www.saucedemo.com/)** web application, a demo site designed for testing automation frameworks.

## Objectives

1. **AI Model Integration**:
   - Develop or find an AI model to learn from application changes, test cases, and results.
   - Train the AI model to assist in automating test generation and decision-making within the framework.

2. **Test Automation with Playwright**:
   - Build a Playwright test framework to automate end-to-end testing.
   - Integrate the AI model to generate, run, and optimize tests dynamically.

3. **CI/CD Deployment**:
   - Implement continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD) using tools such as GitHub Actions or Jenkins.
   - Ensure automatic execution of tests on every code push with AI-based feedback on test results and performance.

4. **Optimization**:
   - Focus on optimizing test execution time, reducing resource consumption, and improving scalability.

5. **AI vs Traditional Automation**:
   - Conduct a comparative analysis of AI-driven automation against traditional automation methods in terms of speed, accuracy, and development agility.

## Features

- **Dynamic Test Generation**: Automatically generates test cases based on application code changes and AI insights.
- **End-to-End Testing**: Comprehensive UI and functionality tests using Playwright.
- **Continuous Feedback Loop**: Integrated CI/CD pipeline ensures constant monitoring and testing of the application with AI-driven optimizations.
- **AI-Enhanced Test Insights**: The AI model provides informational feedback on tests and suggests improvements or additional tests.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js**: Ensure you have Node.js installed. You can download it from [here](https://nodejs.org/).
- **Playwright**: Playwright will be the core automation tool. Install it using:
  ```bash
  npm install playwright
  ```
- **SauceDemo**: The website you will be testing against is [SauceDemo](https://www.saucedemo.com/).

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ai-driven-test-automation.git
   cd ai-driven-test-automation
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Train the AI model (Instructions to be provided once the AI model is set up):
   ```bash
   npm run train-ai
   ```

4. Set up the CI/CD pipeline (e.g., using GitHub Actions or Jenkins):
   - Configure your CI tool to run Playwright tests on code commits and monitor AI-driven test feedback.

### Running Tests

1. Execute tests using Playwright:
   ```bash
   npx playwright test
   ```

2. Observe AI-generated insights on the test results:
   ```bash
   npm run analyze-results
   ```

### CI/CD Integration

- The framework can be integrated into CI/CD pipelines using tools like GitHub Actions, CircleCI, or Jenkins. Simply configure the pipeline to trigger Playwright tests on every code commit or pull request.

## Future Enhancements

- **AI Model Improvements**: Further training to improve the AI’s ability to generate meaningful and optimized test cases.
- **Performance Metrics**: Add performance and load testing capabilities.
- **Advanced CI/CD Features**: Extend the CI/CD pipeline to include AI-based reporting and insights.
