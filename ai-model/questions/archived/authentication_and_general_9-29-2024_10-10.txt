1. Am is mssing any tests in my authentication test suite? <insert authentication.spec.ts file code>
2. What priority are the tests in the authentication suite (from what I have and what you suggest)?
3. My CI run took 1 minute and 6 seconds in github actions, can you review my actions file and find any effiencies I can add? <insert playwright.yml file code>

============================= ↓↓ Answer ↓↓ =============================

1. **Test Gaps in Authentication Suite:**
   - Your current test suite focuses on a basic login flow. However, there are potential gaps in terms of handling:
     - **Invalid Login Scenarios**: Test for invalid username/password combinations.
     - **Edge Cases**: Check for blocked users, empty form submissions, or SQL injection attempts.
     - **Logout Scenario**: Ensure that after logging in, the user can successfully log out and is redirected to the login page.
     - **Session Management**: Verify behavior after the session expires or after cookies are cleared.
     - **Password Masking**: Ensure password fields mask input.

2. **Test Priority:**
   - **High Priority**:
     - Valid login (`can login`): Fundamental for verifying access.
     - Invalid login: Ensures security and usability for wrong credentials.
     - Session management: Critical for user experience and security.
   - **Medium Priority**:
     - Logout: Ensures users can securely end their session.
     - UI validations (password masking, form validations).
   - **Low Priority**:
     - Edge cases like SQL injections or testing blocked accounts (unless specific security goals are involved).

3. **CI Efficiency Improvements:**
   - **Caching Node Modules**: You can add caching to avoid installing dependencies on every run:
     ```yaml
     - name: Cache node modules
       uses: actions/cache@v3
       with:
         path: node_modules
         key: ${{ runner.os }}-node-${{ hashFiles('yarn.lock') }}
         restore-keys: |
           ${{ runner.os }}-node-
     ```
   - **Parallelizing Playwright Tests**: Playwright allows running tests in parallel, which can speed up the execution:
     ```yaml
     - name: Run Playwright tests
       run: yarn playwright test --workers=auto
     ```
   - **Use `setup-playwright` action**: Instead of manually installing Playwright, you can use:
     ```yaml
     - uses: actions/setup-playwright@v1
     ``` 
   This will install Playwright and dependencies automatically.

These changes should help fill gaps in your test suite and improve the CI speed.

============================= ↓↓ My Takeaways ↓↓ =============================
1. The test gaps mentioned all look valid and meaningful
2. My main priority would be the ability to login. Invalid credentials and session management are good test cases to have but I may consider those as a medium priority. 
3. Caching node modules is a great way to speed up workflows. Running in parallel would also be a good option once we have > than a few tests. 
One thing I left out intentionally was that the tests only run for the chromium browser. We could further enhance our workflow by onlyt installing that in CI. 
I would like to see if the model can figure that out with context clues.
